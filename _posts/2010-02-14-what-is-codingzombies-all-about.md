CodingZombies was created because of a belief that if we give, the World will give us back. If we share knowledge we will all learn faster, become better and overall be more happy.

If you got to my blog you are probably a programmer or IT specialist. I want to assure you it's not just another piece of garbage in the junk-yard called Internet. I'm strongly opposed that. This blog was created because I wanted to share information that I couldn't easily find on the internet (and trust me.. I'm pretty savvy with uncle Google). To write some articles I spent many hours going through different documentation so you don't need to. I hope the information contained on this website will be useful for most of you. If not.. if something can be done better, smarter, faster.. just drop me a line. I'm open to constructive criticism. I hope I will learn a lot from you, and that you will learn something from me..

Cheers
